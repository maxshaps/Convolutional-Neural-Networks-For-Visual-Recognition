# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-For-Visual-Recognition

Based on the Stanford course CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks For Visual Recognition, this repository contains several Jupyter notebooks and .py files containing my solutions to the corresponding assignments for the Spring 2017 quarter.



## Data sources

The course materials for CS231n are accessible here: http://cs231n.github.io/.  These assignments use the CIFAR-10 dataset (which consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes (50000 training, 10000 test), with 6000 images per class), accessible here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
